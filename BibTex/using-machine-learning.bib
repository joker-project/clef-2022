	title = {Using machine learning to classify and interpret wordplay},
	abstract = {In this work, we study the first task “Classify and explain instances of wordplay” set as part of the workshop project “Joker”. Pilot Task 1 includes both classification and interpretation components. We use the most common methods to convert text into features. This study is based on the ML technics for elaborating an automated process of classifying and predicting missing features for test data. We use the bag-of-words model and the statistical measure of word frequency - inverse document frequency to convert text to features. Also, we apply polynomial naive Bayesian classifier and Logistic Regression to classify and predict text (with and without preprocessing). The result of the work is tables of accuracy for English and French wordplays. Examples of mostly unsuccessful and isolated relatively successful interpretations are presented. Prediction accuracy for isolated cases is less than 1\%. Accuracy for the manipulation type is also not high, about 50-60\%. Accuracy for other features is quite high, above 93\%.},
