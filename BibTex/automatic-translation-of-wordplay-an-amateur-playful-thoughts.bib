	abstract = {While translating/adapting wordplay is certainly not, for the time being, within the reach of machine translation (be it statistical or neural), the same may hold true for quite a few human translators as well. In my contribution, I will invite readers to take part in a sort of homemade Turing test, by asking them to uncover the translations of three open access MT systems (DeepL, Google Translate, and Yandex), mixed with the renderings of the same passages made by some human translators. All our corpus will consist of English to French translations of some excerpts taken from Lewis Carroll’s Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland.},
