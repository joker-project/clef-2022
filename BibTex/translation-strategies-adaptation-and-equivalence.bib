	abstract = {This paper deals with wordplay translation strategies based on the Joker project and contest. Humour and wordplay are discussed a lot in linguistics as well as in translation studies. Both very difficult to render, they have been the subjects of debates, theses and analysis in many languages. The goal is to analyze the data collected through the Joker contest and find examples of conventional puns or translations of cultural allusions to explain the strategies relevant when going from one language to another. Moreover, my personal experience with the Joker contest and the Joker classification is used as an example of the reasoning taken when translating a wordplay.},
