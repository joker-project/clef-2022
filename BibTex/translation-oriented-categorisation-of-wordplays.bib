	title = {A translation-oriented categorisation of wordplays},
	abstract = {We show here that it is possible to pragmatically base a wordplay categorisation scheme on the different tools and algorithms needed to support the (more or less) automated detection and translation of wordplays, especially those whose translation by existing generic tools is impossible or inadequate. This approach also provides a way to develop metrics for quantifying the quality of wordplay translations.},
