	abstract = {While humour and wordplay are among the most intensively studied problems in the field of translation studies, they have been almost completely ignored in machine translation. This is partly because most AI-based translation tools require a quality and quantity of training data (e.g., parallel corpora) that has historically been lacking for humour and wordplay. The goal of the JOKER@CLEF 2022 workshop was to bring together translators and computer scientists to work on an evaluation framework for wordplay, including data and metric development, and to foster work on automatic methods for wordplay translation. To this end, we defined three pilot tasks: (1) classify and explain instances of wordplay, (2) translate single terms containing wordplay, and (3) translate entire phrases containing wordplay (punning jokes). This paper describes and discusses each of these pilot tasks, as well as the participating systems and their results.},
