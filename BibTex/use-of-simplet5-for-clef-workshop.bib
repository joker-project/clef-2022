	abstract = {In this paper, we present our work in the JokeR workshop. JokeR is a project aiming to study the strategies of localization of humor and puns and to create a multilingual parallel corpus and evaluation metrics in order to put a step forward to Automatic Pun and Humor Translation. 3 Tasks were proposed and to predict the requested fields for each of them, we trained the T5 model specialist in natural language processing tasks. Then we applied the models on test datasets, generating the runs as requested. By doing this we propose a simple method to study the translatability of puns. Also, we propose another way to implement our method to obtain more varied results. All this is to study the multilingual character of wordplay.},
