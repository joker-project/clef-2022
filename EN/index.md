<h2 align="center">Interculturality and Localization of Humor and Puns</h2>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

Intercultural communication relies heavily on translation. Humor remains by far one of its most difficult aspects; to understand humor, one often has to grasp implicit cultural references and/or capture double meanings, which of course raises the question of the (in)translatability of humor. Puns are a common source of humor and are used by novelists and poets, as well as in headlines and advertising for their attention-getting or mnemonic, playful, subversive, etc. values. The translation of humor and puns is therefore in high demand. Modern translation is heavily aided by technological tools, yet few works have studied the automation of humor and puns translation and the creation of humor corpora. To the best of our knowledge, there does not exist any parallel corpus. The JOKER project addresses the issue of European identity through the study of humor in a cross-cultural perspective. The main objective of the JOKER project is to study the strategies of localization of humor and puns and to create a multilingual parallel corpus, annotated according to these strategies, open and freely available.
